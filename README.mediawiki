'''Description:''' RDarkness is a theme created for Habari and tested with version 0.8. Its code is based on a mix of K2, Charcoal, and Mzingi. Even though it is a dark theme, only the main background is dark, in order to ensure readability.

==FAQ==

<ul>
<li>
<dl>
<dt>What happened to configuration and special features?</dt>
<dd>Due to the extensive amount of testing done on transitioning to a responsive layout, I had to eliminate a few things for the test environment to properly recognize it, and those features will most likely not reappear.
</dd>
<dt>What version of HTML does this use?</dt>
<dd>It was made against the W3C HTML 5 standard.
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>
<dl>
<dt>Does this theme work with WordPress?</dt>
<dd>No, it does not because the functions used are mainly found only in Habari. WordPress has different names for functions that do the same things though. There is other code too, but Wordpress will not recognize that either, because the code used, which seems similar to Habari, is meant for Ghost users.

<dt>Why does the theme not look the exact same in all browsers?</dt>
<dd>The layout should be the same, but this theme uses CSS gradients with solid color fallbacks. Browsers that do not support gradient backgrounds should see these solid colors instead.</dd>

<dt>Why do I get less out of this theme on Ghost than I do on Habari?</dt><dd>Ghost does not have all of the same features as Habari and it will be a while before the platform gets into feature parity.</dd>

==Misc.==

===Habari===

There are spaces populated by things I added for my own blog. As of version 0.4, if there are things you do not want displayed, they can be turned out in theme configuration. I ask that you do not edit any PHP files, unless necessary by the plugin you want to use.

In order to keep things configurable, do not remove any conditional PHP statements, especially the recent comments code, because a lot of them are responsible for making the theme configurable.

If you make changes to sidebar.php, I suggest you backup that file, so you do not lose your changes when getting updates.

Version 0.6.x has been tested with Habari 0.9. It is not known if anything beyond 0.3 is backward compatible with 0.8.

===Ghost===

Theme was tested with Ghost 0.8.x and is not known whether it is compatible with earlier version.
