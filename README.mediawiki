'''Description:''' RDarkness is a theme created for Habari and tested with version 0.8. Its code is based on a mix of K2, Charcoal, and Mzingi. Even though it is a dark theme, only the main background is dark, in order to ensure readability.
'''Version:''' 0.4.3

==FAQ==

<ul>
<li>
<dl>
<dt>What version of HTML does this use?</dt>
<dd>It was made against the W3C HTML 4.01 standard, but uses the HTML 5 Doctype because of validation issues with the comment form.
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>
<dl>
<dt>Does this theme work with WordPress?</dt>
<dd>No, it does not because the functions used are mainly found only in Habari. WordPress has different names for functions that do the same things though. There is other code too, but Wordpress will not recognize that either, because the code used, which seems similar to Habari, is meant for Ghost users.

<dt>Why does the theme not look the exact same in all browsers?</dt>
<dd>The layout should be the same, but this theme makes use of SVG image backgrounds with solid color fallbacks. Browsers that do not support SVG backgrounds should see these solid colors instead.</dd>
</dl>

<dt>I updated to version 0.4 and cannot configure the theme. Why?</dt>
<dd>While testing the changes, I found that I needed to deactivate theme, by temporarily activating a different theme, then reactivating this one.</dd>

<dt>Why do I get less out of this theme on Ghost than I do on Habari?</dt><dd>When I added in Ghost support, which was around the Ghost 0.4.1 release, there was much missing, such as ability to list tags, list pages, have next/previous post links, and a few other things. However, like you guys, I wish I could have added everything. I will try to add them when and if I can, but Habari is my main focus.</dd>

===Ghost===

Process was practically the same as Habari, with some differences.

moveRDarkness folder or clone this repo to

==Misc.==

===Habari===

There are spaces populated by things I added for my own blog. As of version 0.4, if there are things you do not want displayed, they can be turned out in theme configuration. I ask that you do not edit any PHP files, unless necessary by the plugin you want to use.

In order to keep things configurable, do not remove any conditional PHP statements, especially the recent comments code, because a lot of them are responsible for making the theme configurable.

If you make changes to sidebar.php, I suggest you backup that file, so you do not lose your changes when getting updates.

Version 0.4.x has been tested with Habari 0.9. It is not known if anything beyond 0.3 is backward compatible with 0.8.

===Ghost===

Theme has been tested with the 0.4.x release of Ghost. It is not known whether it will earlier versions
